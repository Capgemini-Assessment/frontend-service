   cd frontend-service
2. **Install dependencies:**

## Note
Due to time constraints, the functionality to create new customers has not been implemented. Instead, there are 5 dummy customers pre-loaded in the application. When you run the app, you will see these customers listed on the dashboard.

If you wish to add more customers, please refer to the README.md file in the Account-service backend application for further instructions.
